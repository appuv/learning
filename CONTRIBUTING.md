## Standards üéñÔ∏è

To maintain the integrity and quality of the data, the following guidelines must be adhered to:

1. Consider only forms of learning that are completely free, where users do not have to provide any financial details such as credit card information upfront
2. Only learning with a valid shareable URL, profile, or badge will be considered at this time.
3. Ensure that the learning is accessible to beginners and can be completed without any additional costs. We currently accept pull requests (PRs) for new learning from individuals who have recently earned them.
4. Learning cannot be added directly to the free no more and deprecated; they must first be active.
5. Require credible proofs such as articles, blogs, or newsletters to validate new additions
6. To convert an existing valid learning to free no more and depricate, please create an issue rather than submitting a PR.
7. New learning that can be obtained using existing details will not be included.
8. We prefer lists of learning from providers rather than individual ones.
